UEFI Authenticated Variable Store
===========

This variable store implements section 8.2 of the [UEFI Spec 2.7](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20Spec%202_7_B.pdf).


## Design

### Crypto

The AuthVars TA relies on external crypto libraries for PKCS7 signing using either OpenSSL or WolfSSL. See the repo [README.md](../../../README.md#3-crypto-options) for more details on selecting a crypto package.

### Volatile and Non-Volatile Storage

The TA will store up to 64KB each of volatile and non-volatile variables (for a total of 128KB). This may be increased by changing `MAX_NV_STORAGE` or `MAX_VOLATILE_STROAGE`. The maximum heap size the TA will be allocated is controlled by `DATA_SIZE`, currently set to 2x the expected worst case and may need to be increased.

The AuthVars TA's memory is backed by the OP-TEE file system. See [OP-TEE's documentation](https://optee.readthedocs.io/architecture/secure_storage.html) for details. Each variable is stored as a separate OP-TEE storage object.

When the TA is first loaded it enumerates and loads all its existing variables into memory. OP-TEE's filesystem guarantees atomicity of I/O operations, which is a requirement of the UEFI spec. The TA runs in single session mode, so it only needs to access the underlying OP-TEE file system when updating or creating variables, otherwise it runs off the cached versions.

The storage is currently encrypted by OP-TEE using a TA Storage Key (TSK) encryption key which is based on the device's unique hardware ID and the TPM's UUID.

### Authenticated Variables

The UEFI spec describes an authenticated variable store for use with Secure Boot. The TA supports variable reads and writes up to 16KB in size (this is a limitation of the rich OS side driver). This should allow for a reasonable set of Secure Boot keys to be stored.

### Default Variables

The AuthVar TA can encode a set of default variables at compile time, and place them into NV memory when it first runs. This is useful for forcing a default set of UEFI Secure Boot variables to be active during first boot, and as a protection against RPMB wipes. This can be turned on by setting `CFG_AUTHVARS_DEFAULT_VARS=y`. See [defaultvars/README.md](./defaultvars/README.md) for details on configuring this behavior.

## Debugging AuthVars

### Clearing Storage

During development of OP-TEE, if the key derivation functions change, the non-volatile memory will become inaccessible. OP-TEE offers a flag which clears RPMB storage on every boot which can be used to reset all TA storage. Recompile OP-TEE with `CFG_RPMB_RESET_FAT=y`. Note: This does not reset the RPMB key used to encrypt the backing storage, use `CFG_RPMB_TESTKEY=y` during development.

### Debug Output

Increase the debugging level using `CFG_TEE_TA_LOG_LEVEL=4` when compiling the TA. Additional development only debug information can be enabled by using `CFG_TA_DEBUG=y`. Turning this on will print information about each transaction which occurs. This option will significantly degrade performance.

### External Code Debugging

*WolfSSL* sources are compiled directly, so adding `#include <trace.h>` is sufficient to gain access to the full set of OP-TEE tracing functions (`DMSG(), etc`).

Since *OpenSSL* is compiled separately and then linked this will not work. The stdlib shim layer implements `sassl_print( char *c )`, a basic print command which can be added to the OpenSSL codebase if needed.
